It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful monuments in the world. Every year visitors numbering more than the entire population of Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument! A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of Palaces in the Persian language. The tomb is laid out in a rectangular shape and can be approached through a massive gateway which has an arch and alcoves on either side of it. There are water channels and fountains in the entrance which makes the monument even more spectacular. The reflection of this majestic spectacle in the Yamuna is almost poetic in its perfection! Covering an area of approximately 42 Acres, the construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1631 and it took 17 years before it was completed in 1648! It was constructed using white marble obtained from Makrana in Rajasthan. </div>  </div> </div> <div class="col-lg-8 col-sm-12"> <div class="load-hidden project-wrapper__image"> <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://softwaremill.com" target="_blank"> <div data-tilt="" data-tilt-max="4" data-tilt-glare="true" data-tilt-max-glare="0.5" class="js-tilt rounded thumbnail"> <img alt="Project Image" class="img-fluid" src="/pt-1.aa921e5f.jpg"> </div> </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12"> <div class="load-hidden project-wrapper__text"> <h3 class="project-wrapper__text-title">Qutub Minar</h3> <div class="mb-4"> Qutub Minar is a minaret or a victory tower located in Qutub complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi's Mehrauli area.

Hawa Mahal derives its name from its unique structure, which is a mesh of small windows that allowed cool wind to enter the palace and hence kept the palace comfortable during the hot summer months. The main reason behind the palace's construction was to allow the women of the royal house to observe the festivities on the streets whilst being unseen from the outside as was the custom of the land. It is located right on the edge of the City Palace Jaipur and extends right to the 'zenana'. Hawa Mahal is a structure made of red and pink sandstone and has a pyramidal structure which almost resembles a crown. It has been embellished with 953 tiny windows, also known as 'Jharokhas' and embellished with gorgeous latticework. From within, the Hawa Mahal palace is based on five floors each of which has a uniquely decorated chamber. A charming fountain welcomes you inside the main palace, from whereon you can make your way up to the different floors. The top of the palace offers a brilliant view of the City Palace, Jantar Mantar and the ever-busy Siredeori Bazar. There is a small museum as well which holds some rich relics and miniature paintings.
